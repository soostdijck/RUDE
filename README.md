# Robak Unkillable Demon Edition

A 3D printed RC car based on [Robak v2.2](https://github.com/robaki-dev/robak/).

The most resilient RC car on the planet! For those who keep hitting trees or just like bashing.
If you break this car after flying out of your apartment window I consider this project a fail and I will try to fix it.

Requires a 261x261 bed. For smaller beds the chassis needs to be splitted.

## Assembly

At least loctite all grub screws + bolts going in steering links, motor and shock bolts in lower arms. Arms should be able to move freely, don't tighten the M3 bolts that function as joints.

[Info document](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1HM81BQhkKSFr_ZRTIKP950ZJcJBYzyWOIWn2UdTEApA/edit?usp=sharing) not everything is relevant for RUDE but pay special attention to the Diffs. I use N2+H2 and also added shims to absolutely remove all side-to-side play.
