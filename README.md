# Robak Unkillable Demon Edition

A 3D printed RC car based on [Robak v2.2](https://github.com/robaki-dev/robak/).

The most resilient RC car on the planet! For those who keep hitting trees or just like bashing.
If you break this car after flying out of your apartment window I consider this project a fail and I will try to fix it.

Requires a 261x261 bed. For smaller beds the chassis needs to be splitted.

## Assembly

Don't forget to add diff shims on opposite side of the gear.
At least loctite all grub screws + bolts going in steering links and motor.
Arms should be able to move freely, don't tighten the M3 bolts that function as joints.
