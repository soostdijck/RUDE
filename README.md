# Robak Unkillable Demon Edition

A 3D printed RC car based on [Robak v2.2](https://github.com/robaki-dev/robak/).

The most resilient RC car on the planet! More driving and less repairing. This car only stops when your battery is empty. If you break this car after flying out of your apartment window I failed.

Requires a 261x261 bed. For smaller beds the chassis needs to be splitted.

### FAQ: What is this hobby going to cost me?

You can divide the cost in 2 categories: rolling frame and electronics.

Rolling frame: shocks 20 + HSP (metal drivetrain) 60 + metal wheels 45 = €125 (premium parts). With low budget: €70.
Electronics: servo 15 + transmitter 35 + battery 40 + charger 30 + Ezrun MAX10 2400kV combo 180 = €300  (premium parts). With low budget: €160.

Overall, everyone who already dabbles in RC will see that 3D-printers make this hobby much cheaper. And more fun.. you don't have to wait long for your replacement parts.
