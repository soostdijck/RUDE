# Robak Unkillable Demon Edition

A 3D printed RC car based on [Robak v2.2](https://github.com/robaki-dev/robak/).

The most resilient RC car on the planet! More driving and less repairing. If you break this car after flying out of your apartment window I failed.

Requires a 261x261 bed. For smaller beds the chassis needs to be splitted.
