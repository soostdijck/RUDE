# Robak Unkillable Demon Edition

A 3D Printed RC car based on [Robak](https://github.com/robaki-dev/robak/).

The most resilient RC car on the planet because I just keep hitting trees and I can't help myself launching it 10m up in the air.
If you break this car after flying out of your apartment window at 100m height I consider this project a fail and I will try to fix it.

Requires a 261x261 bed. For smaller beds the chassis needs to be splitted.
