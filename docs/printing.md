# Print settings

The chassis requires a 261x261 bed. Alternatively the chassis needs to be splitted or you can order a chassis from [my future webshop?]().

Everything must be printed with 8 walls and 100% infill. Abrasive filaments are not weak but break faster. On the other hand abrasive TPU is more rigid. More testing needs to be done to know what is best.

Make sure to print [this](/Calibration.stl) first for every filament to make sure your shrinkage is fine. As a reference: my TPU shrinkage is 99.8% and for ABS shrinkage 99.3%.

## ABS/ASA/PC/PA12

Also 100% infill!

## TPU 98A or harder

Note: TPU 95A may work as well, but seems much more flexible than 98A. If you try 95A, let us know in discord. I have only used 98A.
