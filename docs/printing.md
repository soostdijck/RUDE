# Print settings

The chassis requires a 261x261 bed. Alternatively the chassis needs to be splitted or you can order a chassis from [my future webshop?]().

Everything must be printed with 8 walls and 100% infill. Abrasive filaments are not weak but break faster. On the other hand abrasive TPU is more rigid. More testing needs to be done to know what is best.

Make sure to print [this](/Calibration.stl) first for every filament to make sure your shrinkage is fine. As a reference: my TPU shrinkage is 99.8% and for ABS shrinkage 99.3%.

For quality prints I recommend this guide: https://ellis3dp.com/Print-Tuning-Guide/ basically walk through Tuning once and after that you only have to adjust PA and EM for different filaments and adjust first layer squish every now and then.

Always dry your new TPU spool for a few hours in the oven at 60C. It's always wet from factory, which makes it hard to print and causes rough texture. If you use a new brand for the first time: set a low speed and set retraction to 0 mm, these can be experimentally increased (especially for harder TPU's) in consequent prints. You may need to do more adjustments but these are most important.

## PC

PA12 is suspected to be a good alternative. PA6 may suffice too.

Also 100% infill!

ABS/ASA are not recommended anymore because RUDE receives a lot harsh treatment and diffs are receiving a lot of forces, causing them to crack in places and your car to make noises everywhere [damaging metal parts].

ServoMount may be adjusted for your ESC. Ezrun MAX10 and Quicrun 8BL150 are especially supported with bolted mounts. [Unverified but I suspect that Ezrun MAX8 has same mounting pattern as 8BL150 and that the Quicrun 10BL120 has same mounting pattern as MAX10.] Please share your custom mounts on discord.

## TPU 98A or harder

Note: TPU 95A may work as well, but seems much more flexible than 98A. If you try 95A, let us know in discord. I have only used 98A.

## TPU

3 walls and 20-40% infill (depends on hardness of your TPU, but a soft brace can absorb some impact).
