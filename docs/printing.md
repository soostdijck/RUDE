# Print settings

The chassis requires a 261x261 bed or the chassis needs to be splitted or you can order a chassis from [my website WIP]().

Everything must be printed with 8 walls and 100% infill. Abrasive filaments are not weak but break faster. On the other hand abrasive TPU is more rigid. I need more testing to know what is best.

Make sure to print [this](/Calibration.stl) first for every filament to make sure your shrinkage is fine. As a reference: my TPU shrinkage is 99.8% and for ABS shrinkage 99.3%.

STEP files are different from original Robak v2.2. STL files haven't changed.
