# Print settings

The chassis requires a 261x261 bed. In discord is a usermod available for 250x250 beds (cut corners) and another mod for 182x182 beds (split chassis).

Everything must be printed with 8 walls and 100% infill. Abrasive filaments are not weak but have worse layer adhesion. On the other hand CF/GF-filled TPU could be stiffer. More testing needs to be done to know what is best.

### Calibration

Make sure to print [this](/Calibration.stl) first for every filament to make sure your shrinkage is fine. As a reference: my TPU shrinkage is 99.8% and for ABS shrinkage 99.3%.

For quality prints I recommend this guide: https://ellis3dp.com/Print-Tuning-Guide/ basically walk through Tuning once and after that you only have to adjust PA and EM for different filaments and adjust first layer squish every now and then.

### Before printing TPU

Always dry your new TPU spool for a few hours in the oven at 60C. It's always wet from factory, which makes it hard to print and causes rough texture. If you use a new brand for the first time: set a low speed and set retraction to 0 mm, these can be experimentally increased (especially for harder TPU's) in consequent prints. You may need to do more adjustments but these are most important.


## PC

PA12 is suspected to be a good alternative. PA6 may suffice too. [For motorplate & bellcranks, ABS/ASA are fine too, but they are too weak for link/diffcase/servomount.]

100% infill!

Part | Number | Support
--- | --- | ---
Link | 1 | Yes
MotorPlate | 1 | Yes
DiffCase | 2 | No
BellCranks | 1 | No
ServoMount | 1 | No

ServoMount may need adjustments for a specific ESC. Ezrun MAX10 and Quicrun 8BL150 are supported with bolted mounts. [Unverified but I suspect that Ezrun MAX8 has same mounting pattern as 8BL150 and that the Quicrun 10BL120 has same mounting pattern as MAX10.] Please share your custom mounts on discord.


## TPU 98A or harder

Note: TPU 95A is close in number but much more flexible than 98A and likely won't result in a good car.

Chassis | 1 | No

UpperArms | 1 | No
CarrierHubF | 2 | No
CarrierHubR | 2 | No
TopDeck | 1 | No
Tower | 2 | No
HSP02016_insert | 0-2 | No

Use a HSP02016_insert if your middle axis can (almost) escape. That one doesn't need to be TPU.


## TPU

3 walls and 10-40% infill (depends on hardness of your TPU, but a soft brace can absorb some impact).

Brace | 2 | No




# Stock body

## Any material

Avoid materials with weak layer adhesion. ASA/ABS bodies crack easily along the thin layer lines. In discord is a mod that includes a rear wing.
