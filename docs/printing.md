# Print settings

Everything must be printed with 10 walls and 100% infill. Abrasives are fine.

Make sure to print [this](/Calibration.stl) first for every filament to make sure your shrinkage is fine. TPU shrinkage should be 99.8-100% and for ABS shrinkage 99.3-99.5%.

STEP files are different from original Robak v2.2. STL files haven't changed.
