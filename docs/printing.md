# Print settings

Everything must be printed with 8 walls and 100% infill. Non-abrasive TPU recommended. Even with abrasive filaments its not weak but has less tensile strength so it breaks much faster.

Make sure to print [this](/Calibration.stl) first for every filament to make sure your shrinkage is fine. As a reference: my TPU shrinkage is 99.8% and for ABS shrinkage 99.3%.

STEP files are different from original Robak v2.2. STL files haven't changed.
