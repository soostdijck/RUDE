# BOM

Special attention to HSP 102011 and 2x190mm + 4x66mm ⌀5mm steel rods which are not included in stock Robak BOM. Also additional SHCS M3 + hex-nuts and 2x M5x40 bolts + square nuts are necessary if you come from Robak.

This car can handle much more power than Robak and is also heavier, I don't advise anything below 3S.

ESC + motor | 36xx or 42xx up to 82mm length | 1 | F.e. 3660 = 36mm diameter & 60mm length, 4278 = 42mm diameter & 78mm length.
ESC + motor | Hobbywing Ezrun MAX10 3665SD G3 2400KV + G2 140A ESC | 1 | Recommended. The newest Ezrun MAX8 & MAX10 sensored series are great. Get your Hobbywing electronics at a local shop, because aliexpress doesn't do warranty!

1:8 ESC | Hobbywing Quicrun 8BL150 | 1 | I use this in combination with the Ysido. Get your Hobbywing electronics at a local shop, because aliexpress doesn't do warranty!
