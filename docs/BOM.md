# BOM

Special attention to HSP 102011 and 2x190mm + 4x66mm ⌀5mm steel rods which are not included in stock Robak BOM. Also additional SHCS M3 + hex-nuts and 2x M5x40 bolts + square nuts are necessary if you come from Robak.

This car can handle much more power than Robak and is also heavier, I don't advise anything below 3S.
