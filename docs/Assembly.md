## Assembly

At least loctite all grub screws + bolts going in the HSP steering links. Arms should be able to move freely, don't tighten the M3 bolts that function as joints.

[Info document](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1HM81BQhkKSFr_ZRTIKP950ZJcJBYzyWOIWn2UdTEApA/edit?usp=sharing) not everything is relevant for RUDE but its an informative read. RUDE uses new differential (diff) housings that should be a perfect fit for every good HSP 02024. There seems to be quite a quality difference between AliExpress vendors. All HSP parts from the store recommended in the BOM seems to last much longer. If your HSP diffs don't fit in the diff case well, consider buying theirs.

Install 190mm ⌀5mm steel rods through the two ⌀5mm holes in the sides of the chassis.

To make sure your diffs last as long as possible fill the inside ~80% with diff oil [50k-100k Cst]. Image below shows how it looks from factory (full of air, which is bad):

Also fill up the housing with grease, keep rotating until almost no grease wants to go in anymore, this will make your gears last as long as possible.

The steering link should be installed as follows (you may want to use the top hole on servo horn):

The bearing in motorplate should be locked with a M3 washer + bolt (4mm). This way its possible to drive RUDE with RWD. The main reason for this feature is to protect your differential from damage when the middle axis escapes.

You need to drill a 8mm hole in the rear of the body, to fasten the body with a wing nut to the M8x60mm bolt that is coming out of TopDeckR.

Tires need to be glued to the rims, this needs to be waterproof so there is no water/dirt going inside the wheels, making your car harder to control. Power glue may suffice for plastic rims. ZAP-RT for metal.

For the rest assembly is pretty similar to [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=374VbFoaV5E).
Note: two M5x40 bolts are used for stiff steering. There are two big square holes in the bottom of the chassis for M5 square nuts.
